        <p>Hi! My name is Melany Chang Mok. I was born in the United States of America, but raised in Venezuela. Growing up, I always had a passion for art. I was not poor, however, I could not join any academy, so I would practice by myself because I felt at peace. Up to now, I still feel the same about art. I'm always distracted looking at everything in great detail trying to understand it. Thus, I feel like this is the reason why I did not pursue any other carrier. Not to mention that even if I wanted to do so, I wouldn't be able to do it because art is always in my mind. Currently I'm studying to become an artist at Borough of Manhattan Community College.
